# Wish upon a star ✨
- A shooting star that will fulfill **some** of your wishes. 😉

# AAOOII, what am I supposed to do in this program? 😕😕
1. Wait 'till a shooting star appears on the screen.
2. Once the shooting star appears, quickly type your wish in the box. Expect less. The program can only fulfill wishes such as **circle** and **square**.
3. If you have typed either a **circle** or a **square** on the box, that shape will appear, fall on the ground, and bounce forever. If not, the program will... 🤷‍♀️ you off.

# Purpose
- This project enhances my knowledge of LOVE2D's drawing mechanics by allowing me to draw a polygon, specifically a star, and alter its properties.
- This project will also serve as my practice for GitHub's flow
